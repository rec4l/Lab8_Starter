Graceful degradation and service workers both aim to improve user experience across a variety of conditions, especially in unreliable or limited environments. Graceful degradation focuses on ensuring that a web application remains functional even if advanced features (like JavaScript or modern CSS) are not supported or fail. Similarly, service workers allow web apps to function under degraded network conditions by intercepting requests and serving cached content or fallback responses. Together, they contribute to building resilient web applications that provide a usable experience regardless of the user's browser capabilities or network status.
